<p>This is a fun learning competition from kaggle on predicting the dish's cuisine type with the set of provided ingredients. </p>

<a id="a--brief-description-of-this-problem" class="anchor" href="#a--brief-description-of-this-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A  Brief Description of this Problem:</h2>

<p>If you're in Northern California, you'll be walking past the inevitable bushels of leafy greens, spiked with dark purple kale and the bright pinks and yellows of chard. Across the world in South Korea, mounds of bright red kimchi greet you, while the smell of the sea draws your attention to squids squirming nearby. India’s market is perhaps the most colorful, awash in the rich hues and aromas of dozens of spices: turmeric, star anise, poppy seeds, and garam masala as far as the eye can see.
         So, with the given list of ingredients, predicting the dish's cuisine is our challenge.</p>

<p>The training set is provided as JSON File which needs to be processed so it can be workable in R. The JSON file was converted in to a dataset using JSONLITE package functions. Several Text processing were done on this dataset to assign each ingredient as a variable in the dataset. Similar processing had to be done on the test set as well so the predicted models can be applied to the test set.On looking at the training dataset, the Italian cuisine has got maximum occurrence. This is just an initial picture of what the train set look like. With this, several models were applied on the data to find the accuracy of predictions.
